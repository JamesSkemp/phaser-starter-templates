# Phaser 2.6.2
Version 2.6.2 was the last official/non-community edition of Phaser. While this version can be used, it is no longer actively supported.

It is generally recommended to use either [the Community Edition of Phaser 2][phaser-2-ce], or [Phaser 3][phaser-3], which is a complete rewrite of the API.

[phaser-2-ce]: ../v2-ce
[phaser-3]: ../v3
