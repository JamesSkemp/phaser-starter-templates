# Phaser 3
Phaser 3 (previously named Lazer) is the latest official version of Phaser.

TypeScript definitions are manually updated, from https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs/tree/master/typescript, as they are not yet part of the npm process. If copying one of these templates you must also copy the Phaser TypeScript defintions and either keep it in the same relative location, or update the project accordingly.
